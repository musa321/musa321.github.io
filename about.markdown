# About Me

Hello! I'm **Shibasankar Dash**, a passionate materials science researcher and engineer currently pursuing my Master of Technology in Materials Engineering at the prestigious Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore. With a strong foundation in materials and ceramic engineering from NIT Rourkela, I'm dedicated to advancing computational materials science and understanding fundamental material behaviors.

## My Journey

My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Materials and Ceramic Engineering from NIT Rourkela (2018-2022), where I developed a deep understanding of materials processing, characterization, and industrial applications. My final year project on "Refractory Lining of the Blast Furnace" gave me hands-on experience with real-world industrial challenges.

Currently, I'm pursuing my M.Tech at IISc Bangalore (2023-2025), focusing on computational materials science. My thesis research on "Hydrogen-Dislocation Interactions in Nickel using First Principles" represents cutting-edge work in understanding hydrogen embrittlement mechanisms - a critical issue in aerospace and automotive industries.
